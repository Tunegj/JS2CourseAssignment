OVERVIEW
I use AI (ChatGPT, Google) consistently during my learning process. I ask it questions about concepts I don't understand, and it provides explanations and examples. This helps me grasp new topics quicker.

During the reading portion of the course I ask ChatGPT to summarize and explain material (only AFTER I have read it myself) - and I write the summaries over to word docyments (I never copy paste anything created by AI) - this way I both read and write the material - and that has always been the best way for me to learn.

During development AI was used as a learning and debugging support tool. All the suggestions by AI were reviewed, tested and understood before being implemented.

LOG ENTRIES

BEFORE DEVELOPMENT STARTED:

Entry 1:
Date: Unknown (before 16/02/2026)
Purpose: Decide whether to build a MPA or SPA
Outcome: Decided to build a SPA - as it is more suitable for an interactive blog platform and will provide a better user experience.

Entry 2:
Date: Unknown (before 16/02/2026)
Purpose: Review my Kanban board and plan development tasks
Outcome: Made sure I had all the requirements included in the tasks and that I had a clear plan for the development process.

DURING DEVELOPMENT:

Entry 1:
Date: 18/02/2026
Purpose: Clarification of modular ES6 strucutre and SPA routing logic
Outcome: Improved router structure and route guard implementation. Code written independently and adjusted to fit the project needs.

Entry 2:
Date: 20/02/2026
Purpose: Debugging follow/unfollow endpoint
Outcome: Identified wrong method being used in the fetch request. Adjusted code accordingly and successfully implemented follow/unfollow functionality.

Entry 3:

Purpose: Review and refactor API request helpers.
Outcome: Added optional chaining and JSON parse guards to prevent runtime errors.

Entry 4:
Date: 21/02/2026
Purpose: CSS structure review and separation of layout/components/forms styles
Outcome: Improved project styling organization.

Entry 5:
Date: 22/02/2026
Purpose: Assistance configuring Github Pages deployment workflow
Outcome: Created Github Actions workflow file and configured correct Vite base path.

Just so I am perfectly clear - I also use AI (Google or ChatGPT) for small, "silly" questions during the development process - such as "Is this a suitable name for this variable?", "should I put this function in a separate file and make it reusable?" or "How do I turn off the overwrite mode off" (Yes, I know that makes me sound 80 years old) - And if I can not find where my code breaks (because of a typo or missing bracket etc) I will ask AI to review my code and find the typo for me. But I did not log interactions that had no significant impact on my code.
